Implementing K-Means Algo
(This is what sir explained in class today, please comment if you find any mistake)
1. Record 20 samples of each vowel (5). Cut the sample so that only the speech part of each sample is saved.
2. Get the cepstral coefficients for each frame (+25%) in the sample. This would be the training set.
3. Run the K-Means algo on this set. 
4. For each iteration, log the output in a log file. 
5. Plot a graph of Average Distortion vs No. of iterations.
6. Do steps 3-5 multiple number of times and compare the graphs generated.


Vowels recorded : /a/, /i/, /e/, /o/, /u/ 
speech-samples/raw/
a(01-20)
i(01-20)
e(01-20)
o(01-20)
u(01-20)
