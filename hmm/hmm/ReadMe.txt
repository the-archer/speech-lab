I have implemented the methods for all the 3 problems of HMM.

ForwardProcedure: Implemented the forward procedure as mentioned in the Rabiner Juang book.

BackwardProcedure: Same with the backward procedure.

Viterbi_Algo: Implemented the Viterbi Algorithm

ParameterReestimation: Uses Baum Welch method of parameter reestimation of HMM.

Initialisation: Initialised the HMM using feed-forward model.

Due to lack of time (8 placement tests in the last 4 days), I have not been able to run it unfortunately.
